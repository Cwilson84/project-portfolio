# <Project Portfolio>

## Module Two Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to create a basic porfolio webpage from scratch.  This was quite honestly the hardest project for me thus far, and yet also the most rewarding.  I don't have an artistic eye, so the idea of creating something from nothing was quite daunting for me.  That said, I'm actually quite proud of how it turned out and I learned a great deal more than I ever would've expected from such a "simple" task.  I also believe that it meets all requirements listed below:

- Upon page load, presented with a recent picture and links to content sections;
- All links function as intended and relocate users to the desired content;
- Projects section contains linked images that direct to their deployed project on click, as well as both increased size and project specific information on  hover;
- Page conatains a bonus navbar with the contacts functioning as links to their respective meida;
- Page is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, and renders as intended in all tested variations;

## Credits

As I mentioned above, this was by far the most bewildering project I have done to date.  The normal heavy lifters, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and, of course, [Google](https://www.google.com) were invaluable as ever.  New this time to save the day were a great many posts, discussions, and articles available at [Stack-Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) and a wealth of inspiration from Dev Tooling every site I landed on while searching for anything.  Thanks for checking this out, and stay tuned for more!
